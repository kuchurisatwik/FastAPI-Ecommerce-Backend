# FastAPI E-commerce Backend

Welcome to my first ever project! I've built this e-commerce backend from scratch using FastAPI.

## About This Project

This project is a learning experience for me, and I'm excited to share it. It serves as the backend for a potential e-commerce application, providing APIs for managing products, users, and orders.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login.
*   **Product Management:** APIs to create, read, update, and delete products.
*   **Order Processing:** Basic implementation for creating and managing orders.

## Technologies Used

*   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
*   **SQLAlchemy:** For database interactions.
*   **Pydantic:** For data validation.
